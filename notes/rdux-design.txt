Redux Store Design:
 1- Identify what state exists in the app.
  i- name: string
  ii- cost: number
  iii- searchTerm: string
  iv- cars: Array of {id, name, cost}

 2- Identify how that state changes over the time.
    i- change name
    ii- change cost
    iii- change search term
    iv- add car
    v- remove car
  * Create miny reducer function for each of above:
    i- changeName
    ii- changeCost
    iii- changeSearchTerm
    iv- addCar
    v- removeCar

 3- Group together common pieces of state.
  ** different engineers are gonig to come with different answers.

  a: State related to adding cars:
    i- name.
    ii- cost.

  b: State related to the list of car:
